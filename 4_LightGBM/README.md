# LightGBM Recommendation System

This module implements a recommendation system using LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. The system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their previous purchase behavior.

## Overview

The LightGBM recommendation system follows these main steps:

1. **Negative Sampling**: Generate negative samples (products not purchased) to balance with positive samples (products purchased).
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract and process features from interaction data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a LightGBM model to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Rank products based on predicted scores and recommend the top K products to each customer.
5. **Evaluation**: Measure the quality of recommendations using metrics like hitrate@k.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- lightgbm
- scikit-learn
- torch (for negative sampling with GPU acceleration)

## Advantages of LightGBM

- Fast training speed and high efficiency
- Lower memory usage
- Better accuracy than many other boosting algorithms
- Support for parallel, distributed, and GPU learning
- Capable of handling large-scale data
- Interpretable feature importance

## Limitations

- Requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting
- May not capture complex interactions between features as well as deep learning methods
- Limited ability to handle sparse data compared to specialized recommendation algorithms

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more features such as product descriptions and customer demographics
- Implement cross-validation to improve model robustness
- Explore hybrid approaches combining LightGBM with collaborative filtering
- Add time-based splitting for temporal validation
